            "1": "2 pounds sliced beef liver"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.5 cups milk, or as needed"
        },
        {
            "3": "0.25 cup butter, divided"
        },
        {
            "4": "2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings"
        },
        {
            "5": "2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed"

        {
            "6": "1 salt and pepper to taste"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Gently rinse liver slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a shallow dish; pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions, or set aside for longer if you have time. Soaking will remove any bitterness."

            "2": "Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion rings; cook and stir in butter until tender and soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions into a bowl and set the skillet aside."
        },
        {
            "3": "Place flour on a plate; season with salt and pepper. Drain milk from liver and coat liver slices in flour mixture."
        },
        {
            "4": "Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet; increase heat to medium-high and fry coated liver slices until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Return onions to the skillet and reduce heat to medium; continue to cook until onions are heated through and liver is slightly pink inside, or longer to suit your taste."
