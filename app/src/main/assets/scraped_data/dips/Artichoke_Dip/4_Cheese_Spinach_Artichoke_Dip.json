Add onion, garlic, pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes; cook, stirring regularly so it doesn't burn on the bottom, until spinach has wilted and mixture is wet, about 3 minutes."

Stir occasionally and allow to simmer, uncovered, until cheeses have melted and some of the water from the spinach has cooked off, about 3 more minutes. This allows the herbs and spices to infuse their flavor into the dip. Serve hot."
