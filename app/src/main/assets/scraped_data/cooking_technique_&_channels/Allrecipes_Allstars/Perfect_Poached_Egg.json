        {
            "1": "1 large egg"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 tablespoon white vinegar"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Fill a large pot with at least 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce temperature to low--the water is ready when you see bubbles at the bottom of the pot, but there should be no bubbles breaking the surface of the water."
        },
        {
            "2": "Crack egg into a small-mesh sieve, allow it to drain, and then transfer the egg to a small bowl or ramekin in order to avoid a runny egg white. This step will give you a better-shaped poached egg with tighter whites."
        },
        {
            "3": "When water is at the right temperature, stir in about 1 tablespoon white vinegar which helps the egg white coagulate. Using a spoon, swirl the water in the center of the pot into a vortex or whirlpool, and carefully add egg to the center. Cook until egg white is set, but the yolk is still soft and runny, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook."
        },
        {
            "4": "Transfer the egg to a paper towel to remove excess water using a slotted spoon. Serve immediately."
