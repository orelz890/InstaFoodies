    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil. Add beans and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. (The beans will not soften too much more during baking, so if you want them softer, cook to your preference.)"

            "2": "Drain beans, run under cold water, and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. When beans are chilled, drain and set aside."

        {
            "5": "Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stirring well to combine. Gradually pour in chicken stock, soy sauce, Dijon, and thyme, stirring constantly; the mixture will be thick at this point. Stir in half-and-half, salt, and pepper until well combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors have melded and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes."

        {
