            "1": "1 (8 ounce) salmon fillet"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 salt and ground black pepper to taste"
        },
        {
            "3": "0.25 cup chopped basil leaves"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the lowest position."

        {
            "2": "Place salmon fillet, skin-side down, in the middle of a large piece of parchment paper; season with salt and black pepper. Cut two 3-inch slits into fillet with a sharp knife. Stuff chopped basil leaves into the slits. Spray fillet with cooking spray and arrange lemon slices on top."

To serve, cut open the parchment paper and remove lemon slices before plating."
