            "1": "Combine butter, brown sugar, condensed milk, corn syrup, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of the mixture dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Cook for 2 minutes at that temperature. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla."
