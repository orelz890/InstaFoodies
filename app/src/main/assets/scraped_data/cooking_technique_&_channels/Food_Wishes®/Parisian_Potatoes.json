        {
            "1": "2 large russet potatoes, peeled"
        },
        {
            "2": "4 cups water"

        {

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Scoop out as many potato balls as you can per potato using the smaller end of a Parisian scooper, 8 or 9 balls per large potato. You can't get too many out of each potato. If you want perfectly shaped balls, don't scoop too close together."
        },
        {
            "2": "Drop potato balls into a large bowl of cold fresh water so they don't discolor. Use potato carcasses for another use, e.g. potato pancakes."

        {
            "3": "Add potato balls, water, and kosher salt to a large pot. Stir and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once water is boiling, boil for just 2 minutes. Potatoes should still be firm, but not raw."
        },
        {
            "4": "Turn off heat and remove potato balls with a strainer. Allow to drain in one layer on a plate lined with paper towels. Cool until they are room temperature."
        },
        {
            "5": "Heat clarified butter in a skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Carefully add completely dry and cooled potatoes to butter. Brown potatoes until outsides are golden and crispy, and the insides are tender and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. Move and stir potatoes often so they brown evenly ."
        },
        {
            "6": "Remove from heat and serve immediately."
