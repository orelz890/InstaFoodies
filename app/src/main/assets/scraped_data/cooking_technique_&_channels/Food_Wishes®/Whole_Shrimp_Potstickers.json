Transfer to a work surface and knead until dough is very soft but not super sticky. Knead, roll, and stretch dough until smooth and fairly elastic, about 3 more minutes. Wrap dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 1 hour."

Use a rolling pin to roll it into a 3 1/2-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Dip your finger into some cold, fresh water and moisten the edge of the circle. Spoon 1 shrimp into the center, along with a little bit of green onion and marinade. Fold dough around the shrimp and press edges together until perfectly sealed. Trim any excess dough from the ends and either discard or reuse. Crimp the edges a bit with your fingers, if desired. Transfer to a flour-dusted plate and refrigerate while you assemble the remaining potstickers."

Cook for 1 minute, then add 2 teaspoons butter to the pan. Tilt the pan as the butter melts to distribute it evenly and cook until the bottoms of the potstickers are golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and quickly cover with the lid. Steam dumplings until cooked through and most of the water has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and repeat to cook the remaining 6 potstickers with remaining oil and butter."
